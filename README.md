Grocery Store Management System

Description:
This project is a Grocery Store Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to simulate a grocery shopping experience by adding items to a cart, removing items, checking the current cart contents, and processing payments. The system features a user-friendly menu interface and supports a wide range of grocery items categorized into Fresh Produce, Grains, Protein, Dairy, Snacks, Baking Goods, Condiments/Sauces, Oils, and Canned/Dried Goods.

Key features include:

Add Items to Cart: Users can select items by entering their corresponding labels.

Remove Items: Users can remove specific items from the cart.

Check Cart: Users can view the current items in the cart along with the total cost.

Pay at Counter: Users can confirm their purchase, generate an order number, and clear the cart.

This project demonstrates the use of queues, vectors, and structured data in C++ to manage a dynamic shopping cart system. Itâ€™s a great example of a console-based application for managing inventory and transactions in a simulated retail environment.
